    <h1>Our Coffees</h1>
    <p>Andrea Spella works closely with family-owned coffee farms and co-operatives in India, Latin America, and Africa to ensure the highest quality of beans. Strong relationships with coffee growers are the foundation of Spella Caff&egrave.

    Andrea roasts the coffee beans in small batches―eleven pounds at a time―at his roastery in Southeast Portland. His roasting brings out the unique, inherent qualities of each variety.

    Spella Caff&egrave is currently roasting the following varieties of whole bean coffees.
    </p>
    <h2>Signature Espresso Blend:</h2><p>The lush textures of this classically Italian espresso carry chocolate and caramel tones―think cr&egraveme brulée with candied orange and lime peel in the finish. Excellent for espresso, moka pot, and drip methods.</p>
    <h2>India Kattehollay:</h2><p>Direct from the family and farm from Karnataka State, our exclusive Peaberry is light to medium bodied with exotic spices and a snappy finish. This coffee truly shines with drip methods.</p>
    <h2>Ethiopia Sidamo Gr. 2:</h2><p> Vanilla, Nougat, with a Cabernet finish.</p>
    <h2>Ethiopia Chelfit Gr. 3:</h2><p>Spiced Dutch Cocoa, Strawberries and a dry finish.</p>
    <h2>Rossalina:</h2><p>An espresso blend named after our roaster! Thick, lush body, tons of crema, nutty, caramel tones with a healthy amount of licorice and anisette―versatile Rossalina is an afternoon pick-me-up or a wonderful end to a meal!</p>
    <h2>Guatemala "Tikal":</h2><p>From Nuevo Oriente. A truly classic cup! With big-bodied tones of chocolate and cocoa with bright stone fruits (nectarine and apricot) this coffee has.... and on can stay the same.</p>
